## Projects
-**[Machine Learning : User vs. Bot](https://github.com/pasterhatt/user_v_bot/blob/main/Portfolio_Users%20vs%20bots%20classification_V2.ipynb)**
  - Using **Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and the [User vs Bot Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/morpho23/bot-or-not-detecting-automated-accounts)** perform basic data exploration and visualization
  - Compare the **accuracy scores** for Logistic Regression, Decision tree and K-Nearest Neighbors models. Explain the meaning of those comparisons. 
  - Use data visualization to compare hypertuning of the models. 
- **[Data Cleaning](https://github.com/pasterhatt/data_cleaning/blob/main/Portfolio_Data_Cleaning_Commented.ipynb)**
  - Using **Python, Jupyter Notebooks** and a generated dataset, practice common data cleaning techniques to standardize the data for cleaning.
  - Visualize missing data to facilittate sharing of information
  - Created code to fill missing data with the average of the data above and below, rather then use a back or forward fill. 
- **[Data Visualization](https://github.com/pasterhatt/data_viz/blob/main/Portfolio%20_Data_Viz_Commented.ipynb)**
  - Use common python visualization packages and explore the IRIS dataset for insights.   
- **[ML with several ML Methods](https://github.com/pasterhatt/ML_Models/blob/main/Portfolio%20_ML_Commented.ipynb)**
  - Using **Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and the sklearn iris dataset** perform basic data exploration and visualization
  - Perform basic correlation analysis of the data, and visualize.
  - Compare the **accuracy scores** for Logistic Regression, decision tree and K-Nearest Neighbors models.
  - Use data visualization to compare hypertuning of the models. 
- **[Hypothesis Testing with Anova and a Tukey Test](https://github.com/pasterhatt/ANOVA/blob/main/Portfolio_ANOVA_w_tukey_test.ipynb)**
  - Using generated data, we can show that **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) followed by a **Tukey HSD** (Honestly Significant Difference) test is a for testing the average values of different marketing channels.
